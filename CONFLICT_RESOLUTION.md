# PR #2 Conflict Resolution

## Summary

Resolved merge conflicts for PR #2 (Stockfish analyzer integration) when merging into master branch.

## Conflicts Resolved

### 1. package.json
**Conflict**: Different versions of devDependencies between PR and master
**Resolution**: Used older versions compatible with TypeScript 3.7.5
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`: "^2.17.0"
- `@typescript-eslint/parser`: "^2.17.0"  
- `eslint`: "^6.8.0"
- `nodemon`: "^2.0.2"

**Reason**: The newer versions (^8.45.0, ^9.36.0, ^2.0.22) require TypeScript >= 4.8.4, but the project uses TypeScript 3.7.5

### 2. package-lock.json
**Conflict**: Multiple conflicts due to dependency version differences
**Resolution**: Regenerated package-lock.json using `npm install --package-lock-only` after resolving package.json

### 3. README.md
**Conflict**: PR added Stockfish features, master added Pawn Promotion and Reset Button features
**Resolution**: Merged both feature lists into one comprehensive list:
- Interactive 3D Chess Board
- **Live Stockfish Analysis** (from PR)
- Move Validation
- **Automatic Pawn Promotion** (from master)
- **Reset Button** (from master)
- Check and Checkmate Detection
- Multi-user Support

### 4. src/app.ts

#### Conflict 1: `createResetButton()` method
**PR version**: Simple positioning using boardOffset
**Master version**: Better positioning with comments explaining the coordinate system
**Resolution**: Used master's version with detailed comments and explicit positioning

```typescript
// Position the reset button below the board (in positive z direction from board's origin)
// The board squares go from (0,0) to (-0.267, -0.267) approximately
// So we place the button centered horizontally and below the board
const position = new Vector3();
position.x = -0.135; // Center of the board horizontally
position.y = baseHeight;
position.z = 0.05; // Just below the board (below rank 1)
```

#### Conflict 2: `promoteChessPiece()` method
**PR version**: Created new piece but didn't destroy old pawn
**Master version**: Included `actor.destroy()` to clean up old pawn actor
**Resolution**: Used master's version with the destroy call to prevent memory leaks
